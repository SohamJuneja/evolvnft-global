## **[0:20 - 0:40] THE PROBLEM**

### **üé§ WHAT TO SAY:**
> "Here's the brutal truth about today's NFT market: ninety-nine percent of NFTs are just static images gathering digital dust. Once you buy them, they NEVER change. They have zero utility, zero connection to the real world, and frankly... they're boring.

> 
> Every single EvolvNFT is connected to live weather data from six major global cities: Tokyo, Delhi, London, New York, San Francisco, and Bengaluru. When it's hot in Tokyo, your NFT gets more powerful. When it's stormy in London, your NFT's traits change dramatically.
> 
> These aren't just pictures - they're autonomous digital organisms that evolve every ten minutes, twenty-four seven, without any human intervention!"

> 
> We have a smart contract that's already verified and deployed. An autonomous oracle running twenty-four seven on Railway that fetches weather data and updates NFT traits automatically. A beautiful React frontend deployed on Vercel. And a gasless minting relayer so users don't even need to pay gas fees!

> "But enough talking - let me show you this in action! I'm going to mint an NFT right now and show you how it evolves.
> 
> First, I select Tokyo as my city. Look at these initial traits - Power: twenty-five, Brightness: forty, Humidity: thirty. Now I'll mint it using our gasless system... And there we go! NFT minted instantly.
> 
> Now here's the magic - I'm going to show you how this NFT evolved just ten minutes ago when Tokyo's temperature spiked to thirty-five degrees. Watch this - Power jumped to sixty-five, Brightness increased to eighty, and Humidity shot up to eighty-five!

# üìù **TELEPROMPTER VERSION** (Copy this for easy reading)

What if I told you that your NFT could feel the scorching heat of Tokyo's summer, experience the monsoons of Delhi, and shiver through London's winter? What if your digital art was truly ALIVE?

Today, I'm going to show you something that will completely change how you think about NFTs forever. This is EvolvNFT - the world's first weather-responsive digital assets.

Here's the brutal truth about today's NFT market: ninety-nine percent of NFTs are just static images gathering digital dust. Once you buy them, they NEVER change. They have zero utility, zero connection to the real world, and frankly... they're boring.

The twenty-three billion dollar NFT market is crying out for innovation, but everyone's stuck making the same old JPEGs.

But what if NFTs could EVOLVE? What if they responded to real-world data in real-time? That's exactly what EvolvNFT does!

Every single EvolvNFT is connected to live weather data from six major global cities: Tokyo, Delhi, London, New York, San Francisco, and Bengaluru. When it's hot in Tokyo, your NFT gets more powerful. When it's stormy in London, your NFT's traits change dramatically.

These aren't just pictures - they're autonomous digital organisms that evolve every ten minutes, twenty-four seven, without any human intervention!

Now let me show you what makes this technically incredible. This isn't some prototype - this is a fully deployed, production-ready system running on Somnia's high-performance blockchain.

We have a smart contract that's already verified and deployed. An autonomous oracle running twenty-four seven on Railway that fetches weather data and updates NFT traits automatically. A beautiful React frontend deployed on Vercel. And a gasless minting relayer so users don't even need to pay gas fees!

The entire system costs just fifteen dollars per month to run and operates with one hundred percent reliability. No downtime, no failed transactions, no maintenance required.

But enough talking - let me show you this in action! I'm going to mint an NFT right now and show you how it evolves.

First, I select Tokyo as my city. Look at these initial traits - Power: twenty-five, Brightness: forty, Humidity: thirty. Now I'll mint it using our gasless system... And there we go! NFT minted instantly.

Now here's the magic - I'm going to show you how this NFT evolved just ten minutes ago when Tokyo's temperature spiked to thirty-five degrees. Watch this - Power jumped to sixty-five, Brightness increased to eighty, and Humidity shot up to eighty-five!

And this happens automatically, every ten minutes, based on real weather data. Your NFT is literally alive and responding to the world around us!

This isn't just cool technology - this is the future of digital ownership. We've created the world's first truly dynamic NFT that bridges the gap between digital assets and the physical world.

Artists can now create time-based, reactive art. Collectors get assets that surprise them daily. And developers have a proven template for building autonomous blockchain applications.

We're not just participating in the NFT market - we're creating an entirely new category: Living Digital Assets.

The static NFT era is over. The future belongs to assets that live, breathe, and evolve with our world. EvolvNFT isn't just a project - it's proof that Web3 can deliver on its promise of connecting digital assets to reality.

We've built it, deployed it, and it's running right now. The question isn't whether dynamic NFTs are the future - it's whether you're ready to be part of that future.

Welcome to the age of Living Digital Assets. Welcome to EvolvNFT.
