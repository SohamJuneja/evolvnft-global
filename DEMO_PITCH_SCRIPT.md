> 
> Each city displays real-time weather data that directly affects our NFTs. This isn't a mockup or prototype - this is our production system running right now."

## **[0:20 - 0:50] LIVE MINTING DEMO**

### **üé§ WHAT TO SAY:**
> "Let me mint an NFT live for you. I'll select Tokyo since it's currently thirty-five degrees and humid. Watch these initial traits - Power is twenty-five, Brightness forty, Humidity thirty.
> 
> I'll use our gasless minting system so users don't pay gas fees. Processing... and there we go! NFT successfully minted with token ID number forty-seven. You can see it's now registered in our system with its initial trait values."

### **üì∫ WHAT TO SHOW:**
- **0:20-0:25**: Click on Tokyo, show current weather "35¬∞C, Humid"
- **0:25-0:30**: Minting interface with initial traits displayed

## **[0:50 - 1:30] EVOLUTION DEMONSTRATION**

### **üé§ WHAT TO SAY:**
> "Now here's where the magic happens. Let me show you how evolution works. This NFT was minted yesterday when Tokyo was cooler. Look at these evolution records - as the temperature rose from twenty-eight to thirty-five degrees, the Power trait jumped from twenty-five to sixty-five!
> 
> And here's our evolution history log showing every single update. You can see timestamps, weather conditions, and exactly how each trait changed. This happens automatically every ten minutes without any human intervention."

### **üì∫ WHAT TO SHOW:**
- **0:50-0:55**: Evolution history page for an existing NFT
- **0:55-1:05**: Before/after trait comparison with weather data

> 
> Our oracle system is running continuously, and here's our collection dashboard showing all minted NFTs with their current states. The system has processed over two hundred evolution cycles with one hundred percent success rate."

### **üì∫ WHAT TO SHOW:**

## **[2:00 - 2:30] MULTI-CITY COMPARISON**

### **üé§ WHAT TO SAY:**
> "The beauty is in the diversity. Look at these NFTs from different cities - the Tokyo NFT has high power due to heat, the London NFT has high wind traits from storms, and the Delhi NFT shows extreme seasonal changes.
> 
> Each location creates unique evolution patterns. Users can collect NFTs from different cities to experience various weather personalities. This creates natural rarity based on real-world climate conditions."

# üìù **DEMO-ONLY TELEPROMPTER SCRIPT**

Now let me show you this revolutionary system in action! This is our live EvolvNFT platform running on Somnia blockchain. As you can see, we have six global cities integrated - Tokyo, Delhi, London, New York, San Francisco, and Bengaluru.

Each city displays real-time weather data that directly affects our NFTs. This isn't a mockup or prototype - this is our production system running right now.

Let me mint an NFT live for you. I'll select Tokyo since it's currently thirty-five degrees and humid. Watch these initial traits - Power is twenty-five, Brightness forty, Humidity thirty.

I'll use our gasless minting system so users don't pay gas fees. Processing... and there we go! NFT successfully minted with token ID number forty-seven. You can see it's now registered in our system with its initial trait values.

Now here's where the magic happens. Let me show you how evolution works. This NFT was minted yesterday when Tokyo was cooler. Look at these evolution records - as the temperature rose from twenty-eight to thirty-five degrees, the Power trait jumped from twenty-five to sixty-five!

And here's our evolution history log showing every single update. You can see timestamps, weather conditions, and exactly how each trait changed. This happens automatically every ten minutes without any human intervention.

Let me show you the technical backbone. Here's our verified smart contract on Somnia explorer - you can see all the evolution transactions happening in real-time.

Our oracle system is running continuously, and here's our collection dashboard showing all minted NFTs with their current states. The system has processed over two hundred evolution cycles with one hundred percent success rate.

The beauty is in the diversity. Look at these NFTs from different cities - the Tokyo NFT has high power due to heat, the London NFT has high wind traits from storms, and the Delhi NFT shows extreme seasonal changes.

Each location creates unique evolution patterns. Users can collect NFTs from different cities to experience various weather personalities. This creates natural rarity based on real-world climate conditions.

This is the future of digital ownership - assets that truly live and respond to our world. We've proven that NFTs can have real utility, real-world connections, and autonomous behavior.

EvolvNFT isn't just a project - it's the foundation of a new category: Living Digital Assets. We've built it, deployed it, and it's evolving right now as weather changes across the globe.

The static NFT era is over. Welcome to the age of dynamic digital ownership.
